Debian README for racoon 
------------------------

This package requires a 2.6 kernel with IPSEC available, or a 2.4 kernel
with the new IPSEC backport as in the latest 2.4 kernel source in sid and
sarge.

Please note that the xfrm_user.o module must be loaded unless statically
compiled into the kernel so that the /proc/net/pfkey file is available for
setkey and racoon.

If a suitable kernel is not installed, or /proc/net/pfkey is not available
racoon will fail to start properly.

You will also have to make sure all required kernel encryption and xfrm 
modules are loaded, or that they are statically linked if using 'direct' 
debconf configuration.

racoon-tool
-----------
racoon-tool is now officially deprecated. It used to be the preferred method 
of configuration in older releases (till 0.3.1) but is now deprecated because 
of several reasons; it's debian specific, upstream doesn't like it, it lags
behind in features when compared to racoon.conf(5). If you're interested in
using the latest and greatest feature in racoon, use /etc/racoon/racoon.conf
directly. 

iPhone OS Support
--------------------

The iPhone OS has a strange set of VPN features.  Using L2TP over IPsec 
it only supports main mode with pre-shared keys (no certificates). 
Since L2TP provides the per-user authentication we want to use a single 
pre-shared key for all VPN users, but this is hard to do with 
ipsec-tools since racoon only supports pskey lookup by address when 
identity protection is used and we do not know the address of the client 
in advance. There is now support for a wildcard match in psk.txt. Simply
specify * in the id-filed of psk.txt to match any client.
