ipsec-tools (0.3.3-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Didn't properly fix Bug #285103.  This upload fixes it by adjusting the
    config scripts.  Priority set to medium to make sure that the 3 RC bugs get
    cleared promptly from testing version. Removed use of ed as this tool
    is only used in  racoon.postint, and is not needed by any package essential
    to run a firewall.

    fix the woody backport support.

ipsec-tools (0.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Security upload. Correct urgency so that it will be accepted into

    and CAN-2004-0155.
  * New upstrem release.  Fixes remote DoS in racoon (CAN-2004-0403)
    (closes: #244182).  Repeated for sake of BTS.

  * New upstrem release.  Fixes remote DoS in racoon (CAN-2004-0403)
    (closes: #244182)
  * Enable shared libraries for libipsec - had been turned off upstream.
  * Removed support for GNU readline as there is definitely a licensing
    conflist, and it breadks the stdin processing of setkey which is needed
    for racoon-tool.
  * rpm building Makefile was causing a lot of grief by recursively calling
    toplevel makefile.  Removed from configure.ac
  * Removed autoconf from build targets as rebuilding Makefile.in makes
    debian/rules clean target non-idempotent.
  * Security release, set urgency to high.

  * Reorganised the debconf screens as there was too many of them.
    Closes: #240056.  Removal of one of the screens - Closes: #240010

    things needed to get racoon starting properly.
  * Replaced racoon.conf with a far simpler one to make sure racoon
    has a good chance of starting properly. Closes: #209226
  * Made sure packaged is autoconfed correctly.  This was causing
    trouble when building with set CC, CPP and CFLAGS in environment.
    Closes: #229614
  * Set racoon and ipsec-tools priorities to optional, shouldn't be extra.
